An arithmetic game using PyQT5

This project is inspired by the classic [Zetamac Arithmetic Game](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/). I made some modifications, including a -1 score for incorrect answers and other additional features.

## Requirements
```bash
pip install pyqt5
```
## Launch Game
```bash
python main.py
```

Have fun!
